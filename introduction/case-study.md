# Case Study

## The Situation

Today you have data in different systems and places. You need to bring data together into one place to create visibility of your network. With many different data languages combined with the scale of this data, the problem has become difficult to solve â€“ the data barrier.

## The Solution

Data Engineering will ingest, transform and model all of your Utility data into an autonomous, live network model. Then operationalise algorithms for active network control, safety and reliability.

## The Result

Visibility of a changing grid environment with locational awareness of assets, performance and safety to drive down cost and improve reliability.
